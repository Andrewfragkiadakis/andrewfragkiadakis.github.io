## 🐛 Known Issues

**None** - All reported issues have been resolved.

---

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **Peer Dependency Warning**: `@studio-freight/react-lenis` was installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React 19 compatibility. This is working correctly and can be ignored.

2. **Image Optimization**: All images use `unoptimized` prop on Next.js Image component for faster development. Consider removing this in production.

3. **Font Awesome CDN**: Using CDN link in `layout.tsx` head. Consider self-hosting for better performance.

4. **Binary Trail**: Cursor is hidden (`cursor-none`) on canvas, showing only binary trail. Adjust if normal cursor is needed.
